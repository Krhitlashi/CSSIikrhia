CSS themes for websites based on my design language which is used on my website [krhitlashi.github.io](https://krhitlashi.github.io/) as well as in my apps and drawings.

"ſɭɹ ſᶘɔ.css" file is designed to be used for all websites. It only works half of the time. However, it works well enough on Wikis when on mobile.
